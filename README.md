# Description
This is a repository I created to track my computational and numerical approaches to different mathematics and physics problems I find interesting. That includes classical and modern physics topics and other engineering or science-related themes. That includes classical and modern physics topics and other engineering or science-related themes. This repository will also serve as a record of my programming-learning journey. I expect to use codes such as
- Python,
- Julia,
- C/C++,
- OCaml,

and possibly other programming languages. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments for (potential) improvements. The topics covered so far are the following:

#### Classical physics
- [x] Classical mechanics.
- [x] Classical optics.

#### Modern physics
- [ ] Quantum mechanics.
- [x] Quantum information.
- [x] Atomic physics.
- [ ] Solid-state physics.

#### Applied physics
- [ ] Quantum circuits.

> [!NOTE]
> The code uploaded in this repository is mainly written in Python 3.10.12 and Python 3.12.0.
> Versions of other programming languages to be specified in the future.
